# 2016

[Flexbox 101][1] - An introduction to the CSS flex layout module, given as a brown-bag
presentation for the engineering team at [Smartsheet](https://www.smartsheet.com). This was 
somewhat of an experiment in live-coding. The examples included on the slides can be modified and executed 
live by hitting the 'e' key to launch the editor.
