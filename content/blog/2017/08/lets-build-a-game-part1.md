From the moment my Dad unwrapped a Nintendo Entertainment System on Christmas Day in 1985, I've always held
an interest in video games. I credit this interest in gaming with getting me started programming
during my teenage years. It began small with tweaking AUTOEXEC.BAT or CONFIG.SYS to get one game or another
to run properly under MS-DOS, and ended up as the focus of my academic and professional work.

That said, my interest in gaming and my professional and hobby programming have never overlapped. I have
tons of experience as a full-stack engineer working on business and SaaS applications, but have never 
really attempted to build a game. 

This series of blog posts will document the process of building a simple browser-based twin-stick 
(dual-axis) shooter from scratch. It won't be pretty, and I'm going to stumble through and find my own
solutions before trying to research and implement best-practices. I'll be building the game using 
[TypeScript](https://typescriptlang.org) and Canvas, which are technologies I expect to be using for 
other purposes in the near future. I'm hoping to have some fun and learn a few things along the way.

Stay tuned for the rest of the series... :space_invader:
