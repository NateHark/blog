Despite being a great tablet overall, the Nexus 7 (2013) has one aggravating issue that I recently encountered, random shutdowns due to low battery when the battery reports 30, 40, even 65% life. When this happens the tablet won’t boot until it has charged for a while. Another interesting indication that there is a problem is that the tablet will report 100% battery life for far longer (even hours) after leaving the charger.

After a bit of hunting, I’ve arrived at a viable workaround that seems to effectively reset the Nexus’ battery life reporting.

1. Ensure that the tablet is fully charged and connected to a power source.
2. After verifying that the content on the tablet has been backed up, perform a factory reset via Settings –> Backup & Reset –> Factory data reset. Warning: this will erase all settings and data!
3. When the reset is finished, power down the tablet by holding down the power button and selecting Power Off.
4. Leave the tablet powered off for a couple hours (I left it off for about 2.5 hours)
5. Power on the tablet. If the tablet shows any charge level < 100%, you’re good to go.
6. Fully charge the tablet and play on!

It’s quite obvious due to the fact this works, that something is causing the tablet to inaccurately read the charge level. I’m unsure of the root cause, but to prevent this from happening again, I’m going to power down the tablet overnight at least once a week. I’ll report back if the issue recurs.

Let me know in the comments if this helped you resolve a similar issue with your Nexus 7.
