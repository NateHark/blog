I absolutely love [Trello](http://www.trello.com "Trello") as a task/project tracking tool and use it for both personal and professional projects. Trello is simple by design, and therefore eschews some of the common tools youâ€™d want for a stricter Kanban implementation. The tool I really needed was the ability to add work-in-progress limits to Trello lists and be able to visualize when WIP is at or over the defined limit. I thought this was a good excuse to play around with browser extensions, and the result is [Kanban WIP for Trello](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/kanban-wip-for-trello/oekefjibcnongmmmmkdiofgeppfkmdii?utm_source=chrome-ntp-icon "Kanban WIP for Trello"), a Chrome extension that allows you to add WIP limits to Trello lists.

Check it out, and let me know what you think.
