# ðŸ‘‹ Nathan Harkenrider

Hey All! My name is Nathan Harkenrider. I'm an engineering leader, runner, and dad, among other things. 
I've served in many roles from individual contributor to executive leadership at 
a variety of organizations ranging from early-stage startups to publicly traded companies. My writing 
tends to focus on technology leadership, but I may post about other topics of interest occasionally.
