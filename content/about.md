I’m a software engineer &amp; technology leader who enjoys building great software teams and scalable systems.
I am currently focused on building maintainable and high-performing single-page web applications such as 
[Smartsheet](https://smartsheet.com).

When I’m not coding, I’m spending time with my wife and children, enjoying the outdoors, or playing video games.
A lifelong resident of the Pacific NW, I love coffee, and the rain really doesn't bother me.
