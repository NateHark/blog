  Hello, my name is Nathan. I'm a software engineer and engineering leader with experience in a variety of industries,
  from financial services and pharmaceutical R&D to B2B SaaS. I've spent the last 7+ years helping to grow the team 
  at **[Smartsheet](https://www.smartsheet.com)** from about a dozen engineers to 350+ as the company accelerated from 
  startup to IPO in 2018 (NYSE: [SMAR](https://www.google.com/search?q=nyse%3Asmar)) and beyond.
