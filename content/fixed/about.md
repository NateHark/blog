I’m a software engineer &amp; technology manager who is interested in scalability, usability, and anything startup related. When I’m not coding, I’m spending time with my wife and son, enjoying the outdoors, or playing video games.
A consummate Seattleite, I love coffee, and the rain really doesn't bother me...really.
